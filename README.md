# SpaceX Project

This project analyzes SpaceX data and applies a range of techniques including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **data wrangling**, **web scraping**, **machine learning**, and interactive visualization using **Dash** and **Folium**.

The repository contains a **comprehensive PDF** with full explanations, graphs, and results. For simplicity, three main Python files are highlighted in this repository
